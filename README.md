# ASTEROID GAME PROJECT

## step-3 branch

In this step we will add a simple trangle to the canvas so we can see the resizing taking place.

We need to declare the size variable in the script function scope so that both the drawTriangle function and the resizeCanvas() function have access to it.

## step-2 branch

We have added a resizing function that will change the size of the canvas responsively.

## MAIN BRANCH

This is the beginning of the project. In this step we have setup some context for a canvas and made a resizable window.

The background color is plain black.
