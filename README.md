# ASTEROID GAME PROJECT

## step-4 branch

In this branch we will add some star bubbles to the background.

We will also separate out the ship logic into a separate js file.

We will need to declare the script tags as modules for the import and export statements to work.

### QUESTIONS

- what happens in legacy code before ES6 when not declaring module type on the scripts?
- What happens when we change the order of the script tags? How does the flow of information change?
- What happens if we don't declare the parameters to be passed between the scripts?

## step-3 branch

In this step we will add a simple trangle to the canvas so we can see the resizing taking place.

We need to declare the size variable in the script function scope so that both the drawTriangle function and the resizeCanvas() function have access to it.

## step-2 branch

We have added a resizing function that will change the size of the canvas responsively.

## MAIN BRANCH

This is the beginning of the project. In this step we have setup some context for a canvas and made a resizable window.

The background color is plain black.
